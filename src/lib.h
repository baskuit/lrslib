    Index 0 is the denominator, the next `row` entries are the numerator of the nash equilibrium strategy. The last index is the numberator of the payoff of the other player.
    Since only one strategy is returned, we find all valid joint strategies and return the one with the total expected payoff (for both players.)
    The hope is that this strategy is most suited for MatrixUCB (For a zero sum matrix, recall that all strategies have the same payoffs for each player.)
